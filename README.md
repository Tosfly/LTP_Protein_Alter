#Project introductionAim1: determine protein level changes after LTPAim2: analysis on peptide level##StepsS1: Working on each peptide, S/N > 10S2: Find the best fitting for each peptideS3: Class the type of alterationS4: Each class may represent such as new protein synthesis, turnover or isoform changes
